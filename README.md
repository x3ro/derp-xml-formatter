# derp-xml-formatter

A _very_ rudimentary XML formatter/re-indenter. I know one should never parse XML with regex, but here we are.

If you're reading this and thinking "omigosh why didn't he use AWESOMEXMLFORMATTER2000" then please open an issue and tell me all about your favorite XML formatter, because I wouldn't have written this if I had known about it :)


## Usage

Running

    $ ./format.rb input.xml

will write a re-indented output to "out.xml". There is no configuration :D
